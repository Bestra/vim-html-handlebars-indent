### Monkey patch html indentation for handlebars.

Currently this is an unabashed copy of the default html implementation just to get things working.


### Install for vundle

Add `Bundle 'Bestra/vim-html-handlebars-indent'` to your `.vimrc` and do a `:BundleInstall`.

### Known issues

* `{{else}}` isn't properly deindented.
